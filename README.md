# Guitar Practice Assistant

The App is hosted [Here](https://guitar-practice-assistant.netlify.app/)

## Description:

- Guitar practice assistant app, with a built in metronome, and fretboard memorizer.
- You can add new excercises on the left side, which will be saved for your next visit.
- For creating the metronome sound I used the Web Audio API
- For sequencing the metronome I used the [Tone JS](https://tonejs.github.io/) library which is built on top of the Web Audio API.
- The fretboard memorizer is a simple guessing game built with Vanilla JS.
