## Intro

Started as a vanilla JS project, which turned into a full stack MERN application as I'm learning new skills and technologies. This is a practice project whrere I can learn new things and improve on my developer skillset.

## Description

The app is build with MERN stack and using RESTful API design. The client side is written in Typescript. Redux for state management, Node & Express for API, MongoDB as database. Uses JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
