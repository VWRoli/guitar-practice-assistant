# Guitar Practice Assistant

## Description:

- Guitar practice assistant app, with a built in metronome, and fretboard memorizer.
- You can add new excercises on the left side, which will be saved for your next visit.
- For creating the metronome I used the Tone JS library which is built on top of the Web Audio Api.
- The fretboard memorizer is a simple guessing game built with Vanilla JS.
